WWW::NOS::Open version v1.0.3
=============================

This is a framework that makes makes data from the Open NOS REST API
<http://open.nos.nl/> available in Perl.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

WARNING: Running the test using your API key against the live server will
temporarily hit your rate limit.

In the ./scripts directory are two scripts that can be used to test the
implementation:

    ./DummyServer.pl
    NOSOPEN_SERVER=http://localhost:8888 NOSOPEN_API_KEY=TEST ./TestNOSOpen.pl

An HTML page displaying the test data from the dummy server should then be
available on localhost port 8081.

* DummyServer.pl

Starts a dummy HTTP server that serves canned requests as described in the
documentation of Open NOS to test the implementation against a non-live server.
Defaults to port 18081 when no other port is given using the --port option. The
API key to use with this server is "TEST" and every 100 requests it returns a
quota exceeded error.

* TestNOSOpen.pl

Connects to the live Open NOS server, or the dummy server set in a
NOSOPEN_SERVER environment variable, and serves an HTML page on an HTTP server
listening on port 8081, or a port specified in the --port option. The API key
to use can be set in the NOSOPEN_API_KEY environment variable.
